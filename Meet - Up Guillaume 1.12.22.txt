Compare to other Clustering methods - k-means

Dataset Credit? - Compare to synthesized data
In order to see how it is better

Compare to a sample of dataset first

Libraries as Tsne, umap for representation 2D

Clustering to one side and clustering to other side?!
Distribution of different clusters
Split dataset into two parts and compare clusters - stability idea (k too big and size down, at which k does it differ significantly)

Explanation of results less important

Presentation - 7min (to class)
Report - 4 Pages

Technicals:
- Examine performance generalizable
- Hyperparameters - k, Sim Matrix, distribution parameters
- Compare limits of algorithms - ideally, not necessary
- Convergence - not in error sense, at least state it
