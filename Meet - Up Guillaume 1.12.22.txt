Compare to other Clustering methods - k-means
In order to see how to which extend Spectral Clustering is better

Dataset Credit? - Compare to synthesized data first and then compare it to a sample of the whole dataset first

Libraries as Tsne, umap for representation 2D

Split dataset into two parts and compare clusters - stability idea (k too big and size down, at which k does it differ significantly)

Explanation of results less important

Presentation - 7min (to class)
Report - 4 Pages

Technicals:
- Examine performance generalizable
- Hyperparameters - k, Sim Matrix, distribution parameters
- Compare limits of algorithms - ideally, not necessary
- Convergence - not in error sense, at least state it
