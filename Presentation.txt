Similarity Matrices - Noah

k-neighbors:
* Sim
* - no good way of standardization
* - connecting outliers
* + stability control
* + connection to outliers
Results

Mutual k-neighbors:
* Sim
* - no good way of standardization
* - assigning outliers to cluster (crucial?) -> Solution: Identify and remove outliers?!
* + stability control
* Results

epsilon neighborhood:
* Sim
* - need of useful standardization
* - Assigning outliers to cluser (crucial?) -> Solution: Identify and remove outliers?!
* Results

Gaussian Full connected:
* Sim
* - Computationally unefficient (sparsity and computation in later algorithms)
* - need of useful standardization
* Results
