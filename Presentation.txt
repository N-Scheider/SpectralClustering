Similarity Matrices - Noah

k-neighbors:
* Sim
* - connecting outliers
* - connection between different clusters, no good way of standardization, i.e. different scale see data
* + connecting points with different scale
* + stability control -> not overfit
* log n
Results

Mutual k-neighbors:
* Sim
* - no good way of standardization
* - assigning outliers to cluster (crucial?) -> Solution: Identify and remove outliers?!
* + stability control
* + connects points having different scales, doesn't mix scales
* log n <<
* Results

epsilon neighborhood:
* Sim
* - need of useful standardization
* - Assigning outliers to cluser (crucial?) -> Solution: Identify and remove outliers?!
* + if data is all of the same scale -> find empirically
* Results

Gaussian Full connected:
* Sim
* sigma ~ epsilon
* + more (too much) information (global optimum findable)
* - Computationally unefficient (sparsity and computation in later algorithms)
* - need of useful standardization

* Results
